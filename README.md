practice: A folder for miscellaneous practice files.

Getting Started
To run these notebooks, you will need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. We recommend using a virtual environment.

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly cufflinks jupyter

Once the packages are installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the files.

jupyter notebook
